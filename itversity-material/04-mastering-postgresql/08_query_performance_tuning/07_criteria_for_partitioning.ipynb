    "## Criteria for Partitioning\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us understand how we can leverage partitioning to fine tune the performance.\n",
    "* Partitioning is another key strategy to boost the performance of the queries.\n",
    "* It is extensively used as key performance tuning strategy as part of tables created to support reporting requirements.\n",
    "* Even in transactional systems, we can leverage partitioning as one of the performance tuning technique while dealing with large tables.\n",
    "* For application log tables, we might want to discard all the irrelevant data after specific time period. If partitioning is used, we can detach and/or drop the paritions quickly.\n",
    "* Over a period of time most of the orders will be in **CLOSED** status. We can partition table using list parititioning to ensure that all the **CLOSED** orders are moved to another partition. It can improve the performance for the activity related to active orders.\n",
    "* In case of reporting databases, we might partition the transaction tables at daily level so that we can easily filter and process data to pre-aggregate and store in the reporting data marts.\n",
    "* Most of the tables in ODS or Data Lake will be timestamped and partitioned at daily or monthly level so that we can remove or archive old partitions easily"
